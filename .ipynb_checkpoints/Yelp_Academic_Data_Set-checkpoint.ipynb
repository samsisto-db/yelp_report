If there is only 1 person ahead of me in line, why am I standing there for 5 minutes until it's my turn. I stood in line twice (I regret the idea that I had to go back in line) &amp; both time was so long. Instead of asking me how I am and then following that up with an 'are you sure' question, acknowledge the fact that you had a customer waiting and say sorry.
